# Gradient-descent-ML-Algorithm
Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm for finding the local minimum of a function. To find the local minimum of a function using gradient descent, we must take steps proportional to the negative of the gradient (move away from the gradient) of the function at the current point.
I was able to do this project with the help of youtube videos, online courses and my university courses.
